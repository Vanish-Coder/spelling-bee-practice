# About Modding/Contributing
This software is under a GNU GPL-v3 license, so all mods that you wish to share must be open source. **One of the biggest contributions you can make is to add new word lists** and create easy methods to switch to those lists. The main place to send a question about any potential implemention questions is in this repository's discussion tab, specifically in the Q&A tab ([https://github.com/Vanish-Coder/spelling-bee-practice/discussions](https://github.com/Vanish-Coder/spelling-bee-practice/discussions/categories/q-a)). Any and all contributions that are helpful are welcome. However, any contribution that is deemed unnecessary/not useful will not be accepted.
